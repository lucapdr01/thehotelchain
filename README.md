# Description
In this project I built a booking platform with some basics functionalities.
Users after registration and login can select the period and the city they what to visit and the platform shows them all the hotel rooms available with some info such as price, reviews and the number of stars of the hotel. Once a user books a room the order is stored in a SQL db but it is also associated with a transaction in the Etherum Blockchain (Web3.py for interaction).
Technologies: Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
